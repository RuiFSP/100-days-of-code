### R2D22 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Day22 - Capstone Project 17/20 - Folder Organizer
    - This Python program uses the shutil, tkinter, os, collections, and pathlib modules to organize files in a selected
      directory based on their file extensions.

        1) The program starts by creating a Tkinter root window and prompting the user to select a directory to
           organize. If
           a directory is not selected, the program prints "No directory selected." and exits.
        2) Next, the program creates folders for the different file extensions if they do not already exist. The
           extensions
           are stored in a dictionary named 'extensions', and the number of files moved to each folder is counted using
           the
           defaultdict module.
        3) The program then loops through all the files and subdirectories in the selected directory using the os.walk()
           method. For each file, it checks its extension and moves it to the appropriate folder based on the extension.
           If the file's extension is not recognized, the program asks the user to enter a folder name for files with
           that
           extension, creates a new folder with that name, and moves the file there.
        4) After moving all the files, the program displays the number of files moved to each folder and removes any
           empty
           directories.
        5) Finally, the program asks the user if they want to open the destination folder and, if yes, opens it using
           the os.startfile() method.

### R2D2 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Day2 - Capstone Project 13/20 - Write Python code to play the Google Dinosaur Game - Part 2/2
    - Changed the code form yesterday and found a simpler solution:
        - This code uses Python's pyautogui module to play the Chrome Dino game automatically.
        - The image_grab() function grabs an image of the game and returns the sum of the pixels in the obstacle area.
        - The jump() function simulates a spacebar key press and release to make the dinosaur jump.
        - The restart() function clicks on the replay button to restart the game.
        - The main() function plays the game by continuously capturing screenshots of the game, checking for obstacles,
        - and jumping whenever there is an obstacle in front of the dinosaur.
        - The function also handles any exceptions that might occur during gameplay by restarting
        - the game to recover from the error.

    - At the end of the code, the game is opened in the Chrome browser and main() is called to play the game
      automatically

The end project is [GUI Dinosaur Game](https://github.com/RuiFSP/100-days-of-code/tree/master/Projects-R2/Day2)

### R2D1 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Day1 - Capstone Project 13/20 - Write Python code to play the Google Dinosaur Game - Part 1/2
    - The game imports necessary libraries: PIL, pyautogui, cv2, numpy, and time.
    - The game uses pyautogui to press the Windows key, type in "chrome," and press Enter to open Chrome.
    - The game then types in the URL for the Chrome dinosaur game and presses the space bar to start the game.
    - The game defines a function to capture a screen region where the game is located, and saves the captured screen
    - to an image file if specified.
    - Another function detects if the game is over by thresholding a grayscale version of the captured screen and
    - looking for contours with an area greater than 5000 pixels.
    - A third function detects obstacles by checking the color of a pixel at a specific coordinate on the screen.
    - A fourth function makes the dinosaur jump by pressing the space bar.
    - The game waits for the game to load for 2 seconds, then enters an infinite loop.
    - In each loop iteration, the game captures the screen, checks if the game is over, and jumps if an obstacle is
      detected.
    - The game waits for 0.1 seconds before checking again

The end project is [GUI Dinosaur Game](https://github.com/RuiFSP/100-days-of-code/tree/master/Projects-R2/Day1)
