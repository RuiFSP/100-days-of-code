# Instructions
# Read this the code in main
# Spot the problems üêû.
# Modify the code to fix the program.
# No shortcuts - don't copy-paste to replace the code entirely with a working solution.
# The code needs to print the solution to the FizzBuzz game.
#
# Your program should print each number from 1 to 100 in turn.
#
# When the number is divisible by 3 then instead of printing the number it should print "Fizz".
#
# When the number is divisible by 5, then instead of printing the number it should print "Buzz".
#
#   And if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 e.g. 15 then instead of the number it should print "FizzBuzz"
#
# Hint
# There is more than one fix required.

# Initial code
# for number in range(1, 101):
#     if number % 3 == 0 or number % 5 == 0:
#         print("FizzBuzz")
#     if number % 3 == 0:
#         print("Fizz")
#     if number % 5 == 0:
#         print("Buzz")
#     else:
#         print([number])

# Problem1: else: is print the index, instead of number
# Problem2: incorrect syntax of if/elif, it will trigger multiple times if + if
# Problem3: first if has a "or" instead of "and", which will only print FizzBuzz when condition is verified

# Correct code:
for number in range(1, 101):
    if number % 3 == 0 and number % 5 == 0:
        print("FizzBuzz")
    elif number % 3 == 0:
        print("Fizz")
    elif number % 5 == 0:
        print("Buzz")
    else:
        print(number)
