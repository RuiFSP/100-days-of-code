# You are going to write a program that tests the compatibility between two people.
#
# To work out the love score between two people:
# Take both people's names and check for the number of times the letters in the word TRUE occurs.
#
# Then check for the number of times the letters in the word LOVE occurs.
# Then combine these numbers to make a 2 digit number.
#
# For Love Scores less than 10 or greater than 90, the message should be:
#
# "Your score is **x**, you go together like coke and mentos."
# For Love Scores between 40 and 50, the message should be:
#
# "Your score is **y**, you are alright together."
# Otherwise, the message will just be their score. e.g.:
#
# "Your score is **z**."
# e.g.
#
# name1 = "Angela Yu"
# name2 = "Jack Bauer"
# T occurs 0 times
#
# R occurs 1 time
#
# U occurs 2 times
#
# E occurs 2 times
#
# Total = 5
#
# L occurs 1 time
#
# O occurs 0 times
#
# V occurs 0 times
#
# E occurs 2 times
#
# Total = 3
#
# Love Score = 53
#
# Print: "Your score is 53."

# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
print("Welcome to the Love Calculator!")
name1 = input("What is your name? \n")
name2 = input("What is their name? \n")
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

# Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
add_string_names = name1 + name2
lower_case_names = add_string_names.lower()

t = lower_case_names.count("t")
r = lower_case_names.count("r")
u = lower_case_names.count("u")
e = lower_case_names.count("e")

true = t + r + u + e

l = lower_case_names.count("l")
o = lower_case_names.count("o")
v = lower_case_names.count("v")
e = lower_case_names.count("e")

love = l + o + v + e

# sum for final love score
love_score = int(str(true) + str(love))

# print the correct message
if love_score < 10 or love_score > 90:
