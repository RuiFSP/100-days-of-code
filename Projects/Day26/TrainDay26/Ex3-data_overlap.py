# Instructions
# Take a look inside file1.txt and file2.txt. They each contain a bunch of numbers, each number on a new line.
#
# You are going to create a list called result which contains the numbers that are common in both files.
#
# e.g. if file1.txt contained:
#
# 1
# 2
# 3
# and file2.txt contained:
#
# 2
# 3
# 4
# result = [2, 3]
#
# IMPORTANT: The result should be a list that contains Integers, not Strings. Try to use List
# Comprehension instead of a Loop.
#
# Example Output
# [3, 6, 5, 33, 12, 7, 42, 13]
# Hint
# Use the keyword method for starting the List comprehension and fill in the relevant parts.
# First, you will need to read from the files and create a list using the lines in the files.
# This method will be really useful: https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_file_readlines.asp
# Remember you can check if a value exists in a list using the in keyword.

# Remember you can convert a string to an int using the int() method.

with open("file1.txt") as f1:
    contents_1 = [int(line.strip()) for line in f1.readlines()]
    print(contents_1)
with open("file2.txt") as f2:
    contents_2 = [int(line.strip()) for line in f2.readlines()]
    print(contents_2)

result = [number for number in contents_1 if number in contents_2]

print(result)
