# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - [Your Name Here]

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [January 01, Sunday, 2023].

## Log

I was looking for a structured way to learn python and also project based.
I came across Angela_Yu "The Complete 2023 Web Development Bootcamp" which have a mini 
project at the end of each lesson.

### R1D1

Day1 was a beginner revision about variables and how to manage data
Different topics were discussed, such as: print, inputs
The end project is [Band Name Generator](https://github.com/RuiFSP/100-days-of-code/blob/f676cf83ffec04e71e1a2569ebea84a8b1fe62d2/Projects/Day1/BandNameGenerator.py)

### R1D2
Day2 was basically a revision about understanding types and how to manipulate strings
The end project is [Tip Calculator](Projects/Day2/TipCalculator.py)
