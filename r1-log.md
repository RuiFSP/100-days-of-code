# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - [Rui Pinto]

The log of my <b>#100DaysOfCode</b> challenge. Started on [January 01, Sunday, 2023].

## Log

I was looking for a structured way to learn python and also project based.
I came across Dr.Angela Yu [The Complete 2023 Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) which have a mini 
project at the end of each day.

All my projects and training exercises will be separated by day

   - Training folder: [All Exercises](https://github.com/RuiFSP/100-days-of-code/tree/master/Training)
   - Project folder: [All Projects](https://github.com/RuiFSP/100-days-of-code/tree/master/Projects)

### R1D12

Day12 - Scope
   - Namespaces - local vs global
   - Difference between global scope, local and block scope
   - Block scope such as (for, if , while) does not exist in python, different in language such as java, javascript
     - If you create a variable within a function, it only available inside of that function
     - If you create a variable with a block type, that does not count has local scope
   - Modify variables with global scope, inside functions, we need to explicitly mention them inside function with <b>global variable_name </b>
     - considered bad practice to update global variable inside a function
     - we should use <b>return</b> and save that value as an alternative to use global variables
   - Python Constants and Global Scope
     - This is execution for global scope variables, such as 3.14159 
     - naming convention is to use uppercase and underscore if needed: PI = 3.14159
     - This way is easier to not modify it inside local scope
